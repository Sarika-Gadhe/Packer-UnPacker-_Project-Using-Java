# Packer-UnPacker_Project-Using-Java

This project is a Java-based desktop application with a graphical user interface that allows users to **pack multiple files into a single archive** and later **unpack them back to their original state**.  
It demonstrates the use of **Java Swing** for GUI development and **file handling** techniques for managing different file types.

## 🗃️ Overview
